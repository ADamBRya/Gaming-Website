            5 Tips To Help You Get Started In Dark Souls Remastered
        </h1>

        <img class="Boss" src="th.jpeg" alt="artorias the abyss walker">  

        <p>So you want to play Dark Souls Remastered okay then i 
            will give you five tips to help get you started.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Level Up Endurance
        </h2>

        <p>So, I did not level up my endurance in my first playthrough and it made the game a lot harder, 
            as stamina is used for basically all actions such as attacking, running, and blocking. 
            So don't make the same mistake I did and level up your endurance, which will give you more stamina. You won't regret it.
        </p> 

        <h2>
            Fight Enemies One On One
        </h2>

        <p id="enemies">So fighting multiple enemies at once in Dark Souls Remastered will, likely get you killed.
            So try fighting enemies one at a time. Also, I would recommend using a bow to lure enemies to you.
            </p>

        <h2>
            Learn How To Execute Backstabs
        </h2>

        <p>
            Now, as a beginner, you probably won't know how to execute backstabs, which is fine. But backstabs             
            are incredibly powerful. So here is how to execute them. First go behind an enemy, then press R1 to            
            perform a  backstab and the backstab damage is based on your weapons attack stat. 
            Also, some enemies can not be backstabbed and you will find these enemies as you play the game.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Learn How To Parry Enemies
        </h2>

        <p>
            So you have just learned how to backstab. Now you should learn how to parry. This might be a little difficult,            
            but with some practice, you will be able to parry enemies with ease. Now to parry you need a shield, then            
            equip the shield in your left hand, then when an enemy attacks, press R2. If you got the timing            
            right, you should hear a sound and the enemy will be stunned. Then press R1  to execute a riposte.            
            Just like backstabs riposte's damage scales with your weapons attack stat. Also, greatshields cannot
            be used to parry attacks.
